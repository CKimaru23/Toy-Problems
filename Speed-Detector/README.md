This project contains Toy-problem that has Speed-Detector.

The speed detector gets the speed of the car. If the speed is less than 70km\s no demerit point earned by the driver. But if the speed is above 70km\s, for every additional 5km\s, the driver gets a demerit point. If the points accumulate to 12, the driver's license is suspended. It is a precautionary code to make sure drivers drive safely on the roads.
In our case, we are asking the user to input the speed but in real sense, the speed should be gotten from the car directly.
