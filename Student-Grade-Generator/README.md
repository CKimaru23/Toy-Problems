This project contains Toy-problem that has Student Grade Generator.

It takes the student's marks input by the user and evaluates the grade the student has.
If no grade is entered and the user just presses 'ok' it keeps asking the user to input a value.
If again the input marks is not within the range, it gives a feedback and asks the user to click a button to re-enter the marks.

To get started, the user has to run the gradeGenerator.html
